<p>For my thesis I wanted to develop a video game. As part of my teacher's focus in their lab's research based on serious games, I designed the game based on a similar approach. The concept of a serious games is a game that is made for the purpose of educating, not entertaining. I decided to follow the path of the Edutainment genre, which is a game that's mostly entertaining and also includes educational traits.</p>
<p>One of the key things in my thesis is the option to change what kind of educational traits appear while playing the game (in-game Edutainment slider).</p>
<p>The gameplay and educational traits are designed to be played by children of small age (8-10) </p>
